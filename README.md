=======
Welcome to our open source bug tracker! We have heard many users request a more open source platform so we would like to tell our users how to get involved.

### You can get involved by:
* Reporting bugs you see while using the app.
* Reporting advertisements still appearing within the apps you use.
* Report if we are blocking something essential to your app.
* Report performance issues.
* Report improvemnts you would like to see in our new release

## Feel free to discuss!
We have made our own subreddit for discussion about AdClear and ad blocking for Android devices! Join us at [/r/AdBlockerForAndroid](https://www.reddit.com/r/adblockerforandroid/ "/r/AdBlockerForAndroid").

# What is AdClear and what sets it apart?
We are the premier no-root Android ad blocking soloution. We are the first to block YouTube ads on Android. We are also the quickest to update and evolve with the ad companies. You can get our app [from our website](https://www.seven.com/android-adblocker-download.php "Download AdClear direct"). Why settle for less than the best adblocker for Android?

## On to the technology
Our app works by creating an on-device VPN to filter out network requests before they reach your phone. This works in conjunction with our SSL certificate. Using the VPN alone we can only filter out regular requests and not encrypted ones (such as YouTube and many others). When the app is activated you may just let it run in the background and do it's magic.

# What about SEVEN Networks?
SEVEN is a battle tested company with a long name in the game. Seven Networks helped bring [Microsoft Outlook to Android](http://www.androidcentral.com/microsoft-partners-seven-networks-update-outlookcom-app "SEVEN partners with Microsoft"). Not to name drop but we also have partnered with [Samsung](http://www.seven.com/press_releases/2010/SEVENSignsGlobalAgreementwithSamsungElectronicstoPowerIntegratedMessagingandSocialNetworkingonMobileDevices.php "SEVEN partners with Samsung"), [Verizon](http://www.seven.com/press_releases/2011/VerizonWirelessExpandsPushServicesUsingSEVENNetworksTechnology.php "SEVEN partners with Verizon"), and many others in the past.
