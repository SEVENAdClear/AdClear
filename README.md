# AdClear for Android

AdClear is the premier non-root adblocker for Android users. AdClear’s technology filters out advertisers before they invade your browsing or app experience. 

Our adblocker is the best in the market at blocking YouTube ads, and we’re the first on Android to block encrypted ads. As a bonus, AdClear's Firewall and Doze features combined with ad blocker saves battery, bandwidth, and loading times for users, and keeps users safe from malware-infected ads. The best part: it's free. If you want to keep advertisers out, AdClear's here for you.

> **NOTE:** AdClear is not available in the Google Play Store you can download from [GitHub below](#releases) or our website at [www.seven.com](https://www.seven.com/android-adblocker-download.php)
